# QNNs

This repo houses an expirement idea I had to learn both linear and nonlinear data using Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs).

The idea came from [this](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/math/solve-xor-problem-using-quantum-neural-network.html) reference when I noticed that the QNN implemented was able to learn nonlinear data (XOR data) without the need for a nonlinearity like Relu or tanh, etc... This got me wondering, could a QNN be trained to learn linear data as well ustilizing the same model structure?
